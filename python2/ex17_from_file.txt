Now let¡¯s do a few more things with fi les. We¡¯re going to actually write a Python script to copy
one fi le to another. It¡¯ll be very short but will give you some ideas about other things you can
do with fi les.
ex17.py
1 from sys import argv
2 from os.path import exists
3
4 script, from_file, to_file = argv
5
6 print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)
7
8 # we could do these two on one line too, how?
9 in_file = open(from_file)
10 indata = in_file.read()
11
12 print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)
13
14 print "Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file)
15 print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL- C to abort."
16 raw_input()
17
18 out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
19 out_file.write(indata)
20
21 print "Alright, all done."
22
23 out_file.close()
24 in_file.close()
You should immediately notice that we import another handy command named exists. This
returns True if a fi le exists, based on its name in a string as an argument. It returns False if not.
We¡¯ll be using this function in the second half of this book to do lots of things, but right now you
should see how you can import it.
Using import is a way to get tons of free code other better (well, usually) prog
